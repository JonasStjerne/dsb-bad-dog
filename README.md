Service that automatically requests compensation tickets from DSB's "Travel Time Guarantee" when your train gets delayed
 
DSB's trains are sometimes(read way too often) delayed. Conveniently they have a "Travel Time Guarantee" that oblige if your train is more than 30 mins delayed.
That's very smart you'd think: "When my train is more than 30 mins delayed it automatically gives me a new one" - nope! That would be way to easy. 
DSB makes you fill out a way to complicated form, with details about when the train should have been arriving, the actual arrival time and proof of ticket purchase - all information they already posses themselves.

Presenting dsb_bad_dog
A new innovative solution to a problem that should't exist!
Just (automatically) forward your DSB train ticket receipt from netbutikken@dsb.dk to ChooChoo@gmail.com.
The service will monitor your travels. If a train gets more than 30 minutes delayed, the service sends you a email with a link to dsb.dk, where you have to complete the final part of the request form by filling out your personal information and submit the request.

No more time consuming tasks of filling out the form. Use the time you saved to do gardening work for your grandmother to save up for a car.
